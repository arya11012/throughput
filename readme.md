I have made the page for the throughput vs time plot .I have used material ui for the icons which you can see here and I have used Tailwind css for a responsive design of the page
In the backend I have node express server where I have created an api that generates random value of throughout for each second
The update button generates a new graph as new values are generated.
I have used a basic color palette of teal,gray and white.I have used Chartjs for plotting the graph. However I gave also imported the the python code for generating the plot as I was I having some issues of the boken.js library not installing correctly in my local pc.
